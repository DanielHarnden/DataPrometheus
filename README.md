# Data Prometheus

A tool for mapping and generating visualizations of anything.

## Before Running...

Ensure you have [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [Graphviz](https://graphviz.org/download/) installed and in your PATH.

## Running Data Prometheus

Double click on runDataPrometheus.bat. Two command prompts will open (one for hosting the HTML GUI with Python, the other to host the Flask API) and only contain debugging information. Once the Python server and API are running, the main menu of Data Prometheus will open in your browser.

## Stopping Data Prometheus

Simply close the command prompts, ezpz.

## Finding Generated Files

Data Prometheus saves all output to the output folder. Currently, only one image and Graphviz dot document are stored at a time. Or just save them from the GUI.
