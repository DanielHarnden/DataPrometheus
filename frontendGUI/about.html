    <div class="about">
        <h2>There are many institutional database systems that are split up across multiple minor databases operating generally independently, perhaps centralized to some extent, that have evolved from a singular database. Centralizing these minor databases into one main database is a challenge; unorganized column names may result in improper merges, redundant tables may exist across multiple minor databases, and databases may be large or plentiful enough that merging becomes an issue.</h2>
        <h2>Data Prometheus aims to solve these issues by automatically visualizing and merging database schemas through programatic analysis. Data Prometheus is able to intuit relationships between keys and tables without human input, meaning that relationships between minor databases are able to be found, mapped, and merged automatically.</h2>
        <h2>Along with databases, Data Prometheus is able to visualize the relationships between files, functions, and function calls in various programming languages, quickly providing intuitive documentation about the inner workings of code in seconds.</h2>
