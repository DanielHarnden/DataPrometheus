# Data Prometheus Frontend 

This directory houses the files necessary to run Data Prometheus's GUI. This GUI is designed to provide end users with a user-friendly and convenient interface to interact with Data Prometheus.

The frontend consists of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. The frontend utilizes JavaScript functions to call a Flask API (located in the scripts directory), enabling it to interact with the underlying functionality of the Data Prometheus program. A Python http serveris used to host the frontend.
